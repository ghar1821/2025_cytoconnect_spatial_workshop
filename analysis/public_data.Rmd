## Introduction

In this tutorial we will explore some resources for finding publicly available spatial transcriptomics and imaging mass cytometry datasets.
Generally, it is much harder to find public IMC datasets compared to spatial transcriptomics datasets.
Regardless, we will cover some useful resources for both data types.

For both spatial technologies, it is important to check the "Data availability" section of relevant manuscripts.
They often contain links to where the data is stored, typically to public repositories like GEO, Zenodo, or Figshare.

## Spatial Transcriptomics Data

10x has a comprehensive list of publicly available data they made available on their website.
These data were generated in-house and encompasses a variety of tissues and technologies.
Link to website: https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/public_data/Picture2.png", error = FALSE)
```

You can also search [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
It is a public repository used for storing genomics data.
You will get data from different omics technologies (RNAseq, DNA, etc.).

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/public_data/Picture1.png", error = FALSE)
```


## IMC data

Public data is not easy to get hold of.

Cytoforum: https://cytoforum.stanford.edu/viewforum.php?f=10
List all publications that used IMC or Cytof.
Maintained by Mike Leiopold from Stanford. 
Not all papers have made their data publicly available.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/public_data/Picture3.png", error = FALSE)
```
